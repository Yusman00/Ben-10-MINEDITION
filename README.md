Is a collection of 100 mods designed for fans of the Ben 10 franchise. The mods add elements of immersion, including hardcore zombie waves and other features, as well as new dungeons, world generation, magic, decor, and a modified combat system. Most importantly, the pack includes a mod that adds the Omnitrix, the most powerful weapon in the Ben 10 universe, to the game. Note that the modpack is only compatible with Fabric 1.20.1, and it is recommended to have at least 8GB of dedicated video memory for optimal gameplay. In the future, we plan to add more mods, such as Distant Horizon and Create. We highly recommend playing the modpack with friends, and many thanks to our friend who is a co-author of this project.
